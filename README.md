# python-de-obfuscator
A simple, but working obfuscator and deobfuscator written in Python.

## Usage:
The main loop is pretty self-explanatory, so there is probably no need to explain.

## Future:
Well, unlike the Java obfuscator, I see some pontential in this one. Might actually work on it later.
